# Project Portfolio

Welcome to my project portfolio! Here you'll find a selection of projects I've worked on, showcasing my skills and contributions.

### Implementing Speech on Nao Robot
This project implements speech functionality on NAO robot, by the means of LLM API integration and whisper APi for transcrbing the speech of the user. Whole pipeline is integrated in one project. Has been used frequently for speech capability showcases.

### Hemoglobin Prediction Using CNNs
The primary objective of this project is to develop deep learning models capable of predicting
hemoglobin (Hb) levels and detecting anemia status from images of fingernails. This
approach leverages the capabilities of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to interpret
subtle visual cues from fingernail images that correlate with hemoglobin concentrations and
anemia conditions.

### Telepresence and Joint Control on Nao Robot
This project integrates telepresence with the Nao humanoid robot by Softbank Robotics to replicate human movements in real-time using computer vision techniques like OpenCV and TensorFlow. Objectives include enhancing voice interaction through tactile sensors, motion tracking with MoveNet for precise movement replication, and expanding into real-time video streaming for immersive remote interaction.
